Need to add a title to AlbumContentsView at the top
Need to add a back button to AlbumContentsView
Multiselect feature
- Add a selected bool variable to PhotoItem
- In AlbumContentsView, if selected, show a checkmark overlay
- Add a "Select" button in the top right corner
- Tapping Select changes its text to Cancel, and makes a Done button appear beside
- Tapping Done should load the next screen, and we now pass in an array of images always
- If we're not in multiselect mode and onTapGesture fires, then just load next screen with an array of one image
- In PhotoDetailView, use a ZStack + ForEach + offset to get the intended effect
- Make sure matchGeometryEffect animates n images at once
- Update Save to modify each of them

User should be able to play videos
